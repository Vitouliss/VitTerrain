# VitTerrain (Placeholder name, subjected to change)

My simple, somewhat procedural terrain generator that I wrote for a school math project. Generates Minecraft-like blocks across the world depending on how . Trees also generate after the map has been done and CAN possibly end up being generated floating irresponsibly. 98% of the time they will generate on Land and aren't able to generate on water. 

Due to the fact that this is actually old code I picked up I am still constantly editing this to make it fit with my standards. When I'm not lazy of course and actually put forth the effort to mess with math. You also can notice that there is no beautiful tabbed, spaced code. This is because I wrote this before I was using Sublime text 2. I will possibly fix this later too. 


## Wait, everything isn't here?

Please keep in mind this is just the functional framework, not the full application. This is just the CODE I wrote for it in Rblx.Lua. Which means any loadable .rbxm's or any other sort of ROBLOX model file really isn't here. I might push them later in the future though.
